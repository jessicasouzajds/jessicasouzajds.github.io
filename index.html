			    <h5 class="subheading mb-2">Graduate Research, UC San Diego, La Jolla, CA</h5>

				<h1> </h1>

					Lactation professionals help mothers into properly breastfeeding their babies. For the consultant-to-be, this learning process currently relies on: observing the mother and baby pose, the baby’s mouth movements while being fed, and the sounds from the baby during the nursing session.
					Listening to the baby sounds can be tricky, especially because of the similarity of some of the sounds, and the lack of intuitive learning interfaces. After the COVID-19 pandemic and the migration for virtual classes, the need of effective and interactive learning tools was even more evident.
					Our project aims to help lactation students better visualize the breastfeeding sounds, in order to help reduce the learning curve and improve content synthesis. This project involves visual and auditory learning, human-computer interaction, instructional design, and sound analysis for making the learning tool a reality for students in need.

					This work aimed to develop a low-cost finger-based Blood Pressure (BP) assessment tool for adults, based on an apparatus with a heart rate (PPG) sensor associated with a force sensor for measure the finger. 
					The association of heart rate and force, both gathered from the finger's top knuckle, will provide enough information for accurate BP measurement. Currently, available blood pressure cuff devices are precise but still inaccessible by a majority of people in developing countries, and they can be inconvenient for carrying around for specific measurements. 
					In this study, we verified the accuracy of our apparatus from parametric fitting (comparison with previous work) and machine learning, which showed optimistic results when compared to a regular cuff-based device. The next step is to create a custom-built board that will support both PPG and force sensors in a smaller setup for verifying accuracy in a larger setup.

			    <h5 class="subheading mb-2">Graduate Research, UC San Diego, La Jolla, CA</h5>

					The W-air glasses was the first exploratory project as a Ph.D. student. 
					The goal of W-air was an easy way to monitor breathing in a non-invasive way, allowing it to be used while performing regular activities such as sitting, walking, biking, and even during more motion of the user. 
					It consisted of a pair of glasses attached to a thermal camera that would directly see the nose and mouth activity of the user while breathing. 
					We are still exploring what this device can measure, and we are adding computer vision algorithm for improving the nostril detection, but preliminary results showed an accuracy of 97% for calculating the breathing rate on stationary activities.

					During my research internship at Microsoft Research, I was given the challenge of increase the signal quality of a wearable pulse optical sensor (PPG), which had low quality and resolution for darker skin tones. To solve that, we built a prototype of a temperature-controlled system that increases the local blood perfusion by applying heat to the skin surface. Our results found considerable PPG signal improvement for all six skin tones on the Fitzpatrick scale. This application also showed to have a lingering effect on the skin, where the PPG signal maintains improved resolution for longer periods of time after thermal stimulation. The innovation technique applied was filled as a patent under the following registration number: US11020014B2.

					The Ecoshower project started with the idea of measuring the consumption of water and energy of showers. In Brazil, we are facing each day cases where we have to save water due to the water crisis. Therefore, we thought of a product that could easily inform us of the consume of these variables, with the option of showing the utility cost of the shower and making it possible to identify the user in cases of shared houses.

					With this project, I was awarded with my team with the second place of the <a href = "http://sj.ifsc.edu.br/" href="#Home">IFSC</a> Innovative Ideas contest, where my team earned 10,000 BRL to execute the first prototype. We also filled a patent in Brazil (2019) together with <a href = "http://sj.ifsc.edu.br/" href="#Home">IFSC</a>.
