					<h4 class="mb-0">EMG Flexible Electrode Fabrication + Application Game Using Python</h4>

						The objective of this class project is to develop an interactive game that uses electromyography (EMG) signals as input controls. 
						The data acquisition system used is the RHD 32-Channel Recording Headstages from Intan Technologies, which reads and amplifies electrophysiological signals. 
						The EMG sensor used was a custom-built porous graphene electrode in which we designed using Autocad and fabricated using a laser cutter machine. 
						We performed the EMG readings for a real-time application in which allows the user to control a game that contains commands for moving left, right, and action buttons. 
						The action commands are done by the user's forearm muscle contractions, which are detected by the DAQ system in real-time, and it's interfacing with a Matlab software package. 
						The EMG data is filtered and written to a file as a buffer, which is used by the game as the input. 
						The game is implemented using a Python application, that constantly takes the EMG data as the control input.
						This project was developed in the Medical Devices and Interfaces Class, if you want to check on the demo, please click <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VM7Zz9sl7H8">here [project demo]</a> to know more.

						The Face Detection project was performed during the multimedia systems class at <a href = "http://sj.ifsc.edu.br/" href="#Home">IFSC</a>. We used a monitoring camera to gather live images and used the Open CV library to detect human faces and censor them. The idea of this work was to deal with live image processing and try to reduce the delay in receiving the processed data.

						The Ecoshower project started with the idea of measuring the consumption of water and energy of showers. In Brazil, we are facing each day cases where we have to save water due to the water crisis. Therefore, we thought of a product that could easily inform us of the consume of these variables, with the option of showing the utility cost of the shower and making it possible to identify the user in cases of shared houses.

						With this project, I was awarded with my team with the second place of the <a href = "http://sj.ifsc.edu.br/" href="#Home">IFSC</a> Innovative Ideas contest, where my team earned 10,000 BRL to execute the first prototype. We also filled a patent in Brazil (2019) together with <a href = "http://sj.ifsc.edu.br/" href="#Home">IFSC</a>.

						The antenna design project was performed during my Antenna and Propagation class at <a href = "http://sj.ifsc.edu.br/" href="#Home">IFSC</a>. Students had the opportunity of picking one VHF antenna from the ARSATC community, where at the end of the implementation we would have the opportunity of communicating with amateur radios and sattelites on the same working frequency.
						Due to material implementation and different simulation results, we had to customize our antenna different from the ARSATC Moxon-Yagi Dual Band VHF/UHF antenna, in order to maximize que signal quality for transmiting and receiving the signal. We got very positive results on the SWR and the Isotropic Gain for both of the frequencies we were working on. Also, the practical radiation path of the antenna was very close to the projected one, prooving the success of the experiment.
